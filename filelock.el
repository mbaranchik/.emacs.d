;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs has the ability to create lock files to prevent two Emacs
;; processes from editing the same file at the same time. However, the
;; internal functions to programmatically lock and unlock files are
;; not exposed in Emacs Lisp. Emacs simply locks a file when the
;; buffer visiting it becomes modified, and unlocks it after the
;; buffer is saved or reverted. Furthermore, when Emacs encounters
;; another process's lock file, by default it prompts interactively
;; for what to do.

;; This package provides a simple interface for manually locking and
;; unlocking files using the standard Emacs locks, suitable for use in
;; programming. The basic functions are `filelock-acquire-lock' and
;; `filelock-release-lock', and a macro called `with-file-lock' is also
;; provided.

;; Note that locking a file using these functions does not prevent
;; Emacs from unlocking it under the usual circumstances. For example,
;; if you call `filelock-acquire-lock' on a file and then save a buffer
;; visiting the same file, the lock will still be released as usual
;; when the buffer is saved. It is probably not practical to fix this
;; without modifying the C code of Emacs.

If TIMEOUT is non-nil, a `file-locked' signal will be raised if the
lock on FILE cannot be acquired after that many seconds. If
TIMEOUT is nil, this will wait forever for the lock.

Note that acquiring the lock on a file does not automatically
create the file. You can use a lock on a nonexistent file as a
mutex. However, Emacs needs to have write permissions in the
file's directory in order to create the lock file."
