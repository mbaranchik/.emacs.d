;;; Commentary:

;; When reading source code with EMACS, couples of related files will
;; be opened simultaneously. A function/variable defined in one file
;; will be referenced by another function in another file. A
;; highlight of the corresponding function/vairalbe accross these
;; buffers will make code reading much more friendly.

;; EMACS support multi highlight symbols in one buffer but not
;; accross multi buffers. This package provide highlighting of
;; symbols accross all buffer.

;; When new highlight is being added, only the windows of current
;; frame are updated. Whenever frame configration change(say new
;; window is added to current frame), window's highlight will be
;; updated to make windows currently showing always has the updated
;; highlights. This way is much more effecient than iterating the
;; overall buffer-list to update highlights for every buffer.
;;
;; Multi symbols can be highlighted simultaneously. Different
;; highlights have different face. You could add your highlight face
;; to highlight-faces.

;;; How to use?

;; Put the package into load-path, and load the packaget
;;     (use-package highlight-global)

;; Toggle highlight of current region (or symbol under cursor if
;; region is not active) and bind it like this:
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-H") 'highlight-frame-toggle)

;; Clear all highlight of current frame, and bind it like this:
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-C") 'clear-highlight-frame)
